Eventer
=======

A website skeleton to organize events. Experiment with Angularjs, Tornado and websockets.

There are
  - an etherpad section which allows interactive planning, meant to be used as a simple summary of organization
  - a members section where members can specify their availability and see others'
  - a message thread section with a simple forum like behaviour
  - a chat box.
